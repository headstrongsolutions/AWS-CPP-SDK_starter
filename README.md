# AWS-CPP-SDK_starter project

This is a very basic stripped-down known working C++ project to use as a starting point for a C++ application that utilises the AWS-CPP-SDK

You must already have locally built and installed the source for AWS-CPP-SDK and any other dependancies for it.

Also this project is geared for VSCode usage.
